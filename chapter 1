Exercise 1.1:

1- statement : part of a program that specifies one step  of an algorithm .
    Comment : a part of a program that contains information about the program but has no effect when the the program runs .

2- it means the ability of a program to run on more than one kind of computer(operating system) .

3- in common English compile means :gather together or to collect information from different places and arrange it in a book ,report or a list .
 In computer language ,to compile means to translate a program from a high level language into a low level language , all at once , in preparation for later execution .

Exercise 1.2:

1-  
package assg2;
public class Assg2 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world");
          }
  } 

2-
package assg2;
public class Assg2 {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world");
              System.out.println("how are you?");
    }
   }

3-   
package assg2;
public class Assg2 {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world");
              System.out.println("how are you?");
//this is the logic code
    }
  }

Exercise 1.3:

5- the program still works if we removed public in (public class) .
7- the program still works when we replace println with print but the output is in a single line (hello worldhow are you?) .
8- while removing the closing parentheses , the program still works but removing the opening parentheses makes it stop working .
   The same
